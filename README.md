# Insta Followers
An application to display informations about Instagram followers.

## Techonologies
This application is built using Ruby and the DSL Sinatra, and currently hosted on Heroku.

## Running
I'm using the Foreman Procfile manager, as the used PaaS (Heroku) suggest. Just start the app using Foreman:

    $ foreman start

On development, you can use the rerun gem to restart the program in a file change:

    $ rerun foreman start
